SideSetsAroundSubdomainGenerator will detect all the element faces external to that block. But since you have specified tye 'normal', so it will detect the faces that allign with that normal. 
See this part of the code in SideSetsAroundSubdomainGenerator.C :

add_to_bdy = (_normal * face_normal >= 1.0 - _normal_tol);

In this particular case with the specified normal, it is the right side face of block=0, conincidently that is also the interface between the block=0 and block=1.
